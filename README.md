# Add-Numbers-at-anyBase

ASSIGENMENT DETAILS:

Do not use int arrays. Use cstrings.

Add two numbers in any base.

You must implement this function:

Add(char num1[], char num2[], char result[], int base)

Do not convert num1 and num2 to integer!! This will not work if num1 and num2 are very large arrays.
